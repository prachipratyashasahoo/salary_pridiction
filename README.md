# SalaryPrediction
 Minor Project Of my Engineering 

Objective:
In this project, the main aim is to predict salary and make a suitable user-friendly graph. So that an Employee can get the desired salary on the basis of his qualification and hard work. For developing this system, we are using a Linear regression algorithm of supervised learning in machine learning.

Nowadays, the Major reason an employee switches the company is the salary of the employee.
Employees keep switching to the company to get the expected salary. And it leads to loss of the company and to overcome this loss we came up with an idea of what if the employee gets the desired/expected salary from the Company or Organization. In this Competitive world, everyone has higher expectations and goals. But we cannot randomly provide everyone with their expected salary there should be a system which should measure the ability of the Employee for the Expected salary.
We cannot decide the exact salary but we can predict it by using certain data sets.
A prediction is an assumption about a future event.

Supervised learning is basically a learning task of a learning function that maps an input to an output of a given example. In supervised learning, each example is pair having an input parameter and the desired output value.

A linear regression algorithm in machine learning is a supervised learning technique to approximate the mapping function to get the best predictions. The main goal of regression is the construction of an efficient model to predict the dependent attribute from a bunch of attribute variables.

A regression problem is when the output value is real or a continuous value like salary.
